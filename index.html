      <p><b>Heyo, my name is Cole </b> - thank you for stopping by! I am an enthusiastic marketer with a passion for all things digital.
        I am currently based out of Buffalo, NY working as a <b>Digital Marketing Manager</b> for mid-sized, but mighty, agency called <a class="bold link" href="https://cypressnorth.com/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Cypress North</a>.
        I specialize in the B2B space driving actionable leads for my clients that impact their bottom line - whether it be form fills, e-commerce sales, or offline phone calls - but, B2C was my start and still has my heart.  
        <b>My primary responsibility is my clients' satisfaction.</b></p>

      <p>In my current role at <a class="bold link" href="https://cypressnorth.com/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Cypress North</a>,
        I have transitioned away from task-based execution into a position in which I act as the <b>overall results manager for a selection of B2B clients</b>.
        I manage client relationships and the unique digital initiatives each one brings to the table.
        I develop and oversee strategies, and closely track results in constant search for optimizations or process improvements.
        Digital marketing changes fast (and often) - it is my job to ensure my clients are prepped for, and adhere to, those changes.
        Although my clients share ad platforms, no two clients are the same.
        What may work for one, may not work for another; that is the beauty (and challenge!) of digital marketing.</p>

      <p>I am well versed in <b>Search Engine Marketing (SEM - Google Ads, Microsoft Advertising), Lead Generation & E-Commerce Sales, Paid Social (specifically LinkedIn), and reporting (analytics and advanced tracking).</b>
        I am a stickler for tracking results and proving the benefit of digital efforts over traditional media.</p>

      <p>In addition to Cypress North, I operate a <b>digital consulting practice</b> called <b>Sandwich Digital</b>.
        Not only does the name suit my personality, it also has a good story! Many folks mistake Soldwisch (pronounced "sold-wish") for sandwich, so I made it a good thing.
        If you're interested in learning about my services, please don't hesitate to reach out via email at <a class="link" href="mailto:csandwichdigital@gmail.com?subject=Digital Consulting Inquiry">csandwichdigital@gmail.com</a> introducing yourself & your unique needs.</p>
        
      <p>In my spare time, I love pursuing an active lifestyle full of rock climbing, hiking, running, snowboarding... you get the point, pretty much anything outdoors!
        I am such an outdoors (and tech) nerd, I even <a class="link" href="https://bustedwallet.com/author/cole-soldwisch/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">write reviews</a>.
        I'm also an avid traveler always in search of the next destination, feel free to give me a suggestion!</p>
